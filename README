Gioco1 - an Extension to the Plasma Applet "Getting Started" tutorial
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This program source demonstrates two aspects of plasmoid development.
1) How an icon could be associated with an applet or and application in KDE4.
   Several uses for the icon are shown.
2) How can you create a settings page for the applet.
   Settings are _automagically_ stored and retrieved from configuration file.



-- Development --

The code has been created and compiled on Kubuntu 9.10 with:

 - kapptemplate
 - Qt creator
 - CMake
 
The icon developed with

 - Inkscape graphics editor



-- Name --

Gioco means a play, a joke, a game in Italian.
The applet does not do anything meaningful for an end user.
I created it while studying development for Qt/KDE4 in my spare time.

 There is little chance for a name clash with another software.
Only Italian-speaking person may take this for a real application - like 
a casual game or something. Well, if an user attempts an installation 
of gioco1, this would result in an unintended silly joke.


Also, this is my first program with Plasma/KDE/Qt. Hence "1".

Plasma Applet Template
----------------------

You need KDE 4.2

-- Build instructions --

cd /where/your/applet/is/installed
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$KDEDIRS .. 
make 
make install

(your $KDEDIRS is where you install your KDE 4)

Restart plasma to load the applet 
kquitapp plasma
plasma

or view it with 
plasmoidviewer YourAppletName

You might need to run kbuildsycoca4
in order to get the .desktop file recognized.
